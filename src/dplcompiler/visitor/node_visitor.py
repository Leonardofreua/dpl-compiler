#                               Node Visitor (Visitor Pattern)                          #
#                                                                                       #
# The Visitor Pattern triggered by the classes Handler.py and SymbolTableHandler.py,    #
# works with the objective of orchestrating the method calls according to the object    #
# being requested, however, without being directly coupled to the one being executed.   #
#                                                                                       #
